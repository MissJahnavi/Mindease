          <p>
            Once someone has started self-harming, it can become difficult to
            stop. Whatever the reason, self-harm is a sign that someone is
            struggling and in need of support.

            Nearly a billion people around the world (1/8) live with a

          <h2>Bipolar disorder</h2>
          <p>
            Bipolar disorder is one of the leading causes of disability globally
            as it can affect many areas of life. People with bipolar disorder
            may experience strained relationships, problems at school or work,
            and difficulties in carrying out daily activities. Having bipolar
            disorder also increases the risk of suicide and of developing
            anxiety and substance use disorders.
